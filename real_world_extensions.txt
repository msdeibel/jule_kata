REAL WORLD EXTENSIONS
=====================

Some crazy things can happen with dice on a table and also in case the players
had a beer or two.

Once you got the Kata completed according to rules.txt think about how you could
implement the following scenarios.

1. In case a die falls off the table and hits the floor, the current player has
   to pay a round. However, if he (or any other player) is quick enough to catch the
   die, the game continous along the normal rules without a round on the dropper.
2. In case there is more than one die in the shaker there is a slight chance that
   the dice are stacked ("Tower"; one die on top of another) when the shaker is removed.
   This gives the current player a free reroll of all dice that were in the shaker.
   Three "Towers" in a row are another reason for a round. After that the game continous
   along the normal rules.
3. A "Three" in the first roll is a round. After that the game continous along the
   normal rules
4. On a rough table or with enough stuff on the table there is a chance that a die might
   be stopped short in its movement and comes to a hold on one of the edges. The player
   may reroll the die. Three in a row and you pay a round.
