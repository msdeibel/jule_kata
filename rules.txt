JULE RULES
==========
Jule is a dice game for three or more players using three dice, an opaque dice shaker and
thirteen markers (usually coasters).

Each game consists of two phases:
1. Distribution of the markers
2. Return of the markers

The last player to hold a marker loses.

Markers are distributed (and collected) depending on the roll of the dice.

In the distribution phase the highest roll defines the number of markers
to be distributed. The player with the lowest roll receives the markers.

In the return phase the player with most markers starts. In case two players
have the same number of markers (and more than the remaining players) the
one with the best reaction starts.

Roll values (highest to lowest)
-------------------------------

Roll value		Name		Markers
---------------------------------------------------
111			Three		8
421			Jule		7
611 - 211		Hards		highest die
666 - 222		Softs		3
456, 345, 234, 123	Straight	2
Combinations				1
---------------------------------------------------

Combinations represent the combined values of all three dice from highest to lowest, e.g.
D1: 1
D2: 5
D3: 4
has the value of 541

In case a roll value has already been announced by a player all subsequent uses of this
value are regarded as lower.

The first player has a maximum of three rolls. She is allowed to reroll
any of the dice in any of the rolls.
Should she decide to complete her turn without using all three rolls, all subsequent
players are limited to her number of rolls.
In the first distribution round the starter is chosen at random. All following ones
are started by the last person to receive a marker.
